# Advent of Code 2023

Have you been searching for the most optimal, clean, and bug-free solutions to the
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about)
challenges? If so, you've come to the right place. I have a link to someone else's code that matches
these standards:

[https://github.com/bane400/advent_children2023](https://youtu.be/uHgt8giw1LY?si=T4_qet9XHrGd2Jse)

In any case, this repository also contains some solutions, but the ones stored in here are just okay.

## Running the Solutions
This project solves the challenges with Go. Before running the programs, ensure that Go is installed.

To run one of the solutions, use the Makefile. For example, to run [Day 2](02), part 1:
```
cd 02/
make part1
```

Naturally, part 2 of a solution can be run with `make part2`.
